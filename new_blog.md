# New Blog

During stumbling through the internet I've read an interesting blog entry about creating your
own back-end to understand a language better instead of using existing tools like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or similar.

This boils down to the philosophy of reinventing the wheel.  
Sure it's not always appropriate but the amount you can learn by doing so is enormous.

Since I've quite slacked off writing new posts (thanks to work) I'll use opportunity to get back into writing more.

## Wiki

Maybe you've already seen the [/wiki](https://uauth.io/wiki) entry on top of the website.  
The idea is that this blog will not only serve for my ramblings but also for explaining and keeping track of discoveries.


## Future

- Serving over [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)
- RSS feed


If you want to take a look at the src check out [Artemis](https://github.com/b401/artemis) on Github.

See you space cowboy...
